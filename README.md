# Sentiment-Analysis
 Sentiment Analysis Project using Machine Learning and NLP in Python :
Text classification pipeline to predict sentiment from customer reviews. Transform raw text into meaningful features, train multiple machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

🧠 Steps
Text preprocessing: remove stopwords, strip punctuation, apply lemmatization
Feature extraction: represent text using Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF vectors
Model building: train and compare Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost
Model evaluation: measure Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and analyze Confusion Matrix results
Visualization: explore sentiment distribution and generate word clouds for insights
Deployment: package and serve your sentiment analysis model for practical use cases
